Moved by familial concerns at the outbreak of the Civil War, Emory resigned his command on May 9, 1861, an action he immediately regretted. He tried to intercept the written dispatch of his resignation before it could be delivered, but failed in his efforts. The papers of William H. Emory cover the period 1861 to 1873 with the bulk of the material dating from 1861 when he was trying to remedy the problems connected with his hasty and much regretted resignation. The collection consists of letters to Emory from his wife, Matilda Bache Emory, and his brother, J. R. Emory, and manuscript copies of letters in Emory's behalf from General Winfield Scott and Lieutenant A. V. Colburn during the ""resignation"" period.

Moved by familial concerns at the outbreak of the Civil War, Emory resigned his command on May 9, 1861, an action he immediately regretted. He tried to intercept the written dispatch of his resignation before it could be delivered, but failed in his efforts. The papers of William H. Emory cover the period 1861 to 1873 with the bulk of the material dating from 1861 when he was trying to remedy the problems connected with his hasty and much regretted resignation. The collection consists of letters to Emory from his wife, Matilda Bache Emory, and his brother, J. R.
